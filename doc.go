// Package ramda provides a collection of utility functions inspired by Ramda.js,
// designed to make functional programming in Go more elegant and readable.
//
// The package includes functions for:
// - Function composition and currying
// - Slice operations (map, filter, reduce, etc.)
// - Predicate functions for type checking and comparison
// - Value manipulation and default value handling
// - String conversion utilities
//
// All functions are generic and type-safe, making them suitable for use with
// any data type that satisfies the required constraints.
